Multiple Disease Prediction System

- A simple and user-friendly web application that predicts the likelihood of multiple diseases based on user inputs.
- Leverages machine learning to assist in the early detection of diseases like Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease.

How It Works

- Users provide input data through a web-based interface.
- The application uses trained ML models to make predictions.
- Results are displayed directly on the interface.

Technologies Used

- Python
- Machine Learning Libraries (Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy)
- Streamlit for the frontend
- SQLite for storing prediction data

How to Run

- Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
- Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Run the application using `streamlit run app.py`.
- Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

This project is a mini-project aimed at improving healthcare accessibility through technology.
